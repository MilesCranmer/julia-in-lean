Property registry types.

Every correctness property of DynamicExpressions.jl is a closed `Prop` constant
(`prop`). A `proven` entry names a theorem whose type is exactly `prop`; a
`refuted` entry names a theorem whose type is exactly `¬ prop` and a Julia
reproducer script. `Audit.lean` checks these types, the axioms each theorem
depends on, and coverage of the Julia sources.

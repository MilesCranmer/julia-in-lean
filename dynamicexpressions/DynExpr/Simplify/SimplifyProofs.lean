/-!
Proofs of the `simplify_tree!` properties stated in `SimplifyTree.lean`
(src/Simplify.jl:131-149), for graphs that may contain aliased subtrees.

Every write performed by `combine_children!` replaces a node whose current
unfold is a foldable branch with constant children by the folded constant
leaf. Such a write leaves `simplifyPure` of every unfold unchanged, never
changes a subtree that has no foldable branch, and only removes child
references. Hence subtrees already simplified stay simplified while later
siblings (possibly sharing nodes with them) are processed.
